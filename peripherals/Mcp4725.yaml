        VOut = (Vcc * value) / 4096
        The output is a range between 0 and Vcc with
        steps of Vcc/4096.
        In a 3.3v system, each step is 800 microvolts.
  - EEPROM:
      address: 0x60
      length: 12
      title: EEPROM
      description: |
        If EEPROM is set, the saved voltage output will
        be loaded from power-on.
